=head1 NAME

IP::China - decide whether an internet address is from China

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use IP::China 'chinese_ip';
    if (chinese_ip ('127.0.0.1')) {
        print '你好';
    }

=head1 FUNCTIONS

The module has only one function:

=head2 chinese_ip

    my $is_chinese = chinese_ip ('255.255.255.255');

Given an internet protocol string (version 4), decide whether it is
Chinese or not. The return value is a true value (-1) if the address
is from China, and a false value (0) if the address is not from China.

=head1 UPDATES

The module will be periodically updated. Allocated addresses for China
may change. The script to build updates is included in the git
repository for this distribution. Please refer to F<Makefile.PL> for
the git repository URL.

The script also includes some errata for the MaxMind list.

=head1 ERRATA

The data block as follows:

    74.125.16.64/26,1814991,6252001,,0,0

is recorded as in China (country code 1814991), but this block seems
to belong to Google & not be in China, so this is discounted from the
results.
